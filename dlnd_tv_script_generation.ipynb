I set the sequence length to 3, the number of epochs to 2, the embedding dim to 10, the number of hidden layers to 2 and the dimension of the hidden layers to 2. The learning rate must be set to 0.01 or lower because this is a complex problem. With this configuration I was obtaining 7 points of error loss and It did not seem to converge any further.\n",

I will only keep the number of layers to 2, while the sequence length to 32, the batch size to 64, the embedding dim to 200 and the hidden dim to 256. This configuration was converging very slow to the desired threshold.\n",
