# TV_script_generation_DL
RNN (recurrent neural network) for creating tv scripts automatically (deep learning nanodegree)

In this project I'll generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network I'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
